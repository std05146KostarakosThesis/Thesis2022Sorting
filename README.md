This Repository contains all the necessary C++ files for Sorting Algorithms that I utilized for my thesis. 

sorting.cpp --> contains sorting algorithms for integer data input and it records  runtime
sortingOperators.cpp --> contains sorting algorithms with comparison and assignment operations recording
sortingS.cpp --> contains sorting algorithms for string data items and records runtime. It is possible to change the string size  in the beginning.
